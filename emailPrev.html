          <h2>Long Distance Care</h2>
          <p>
            We treat patients near and far. While telehealth is technically the
            term, we elevate the experience with personal touchpoints, virtual
            appointments, optional technology &amp; treatment delivery, and much
            more.<a

          <h2>Detoxification</h2>
          <p>
            If you’re looking to maintain and/or enhance your body’s
            detoxification pathways, you need to engage in active sweating! Our
            favorite method is the infrared sauna where you can sweat out your
            toxins.<a

          <h2>Integrative Response Testing</h2>
          <p>
            At Integrative Wellness Group, we pride ourselves on testing (not
            guessing). Through IRT (Integrative Response Testing), our team is
            able to determine which supplements, services, and therapies will
            benefit you best at every stage of your wellness journey. Most
            patients are surprised that every supplement they consume should be
            personally tested for them… and a person’s supplement
            recommendations change over time as their bodies evolve and heal.
            IRT is included in every program we offer and implemented during the
            testing and reevaluation stage!
