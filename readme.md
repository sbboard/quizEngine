<div

```

Put the **/quizAssets/** folder in the **root** directory of your website.

- If you put it in a subdirectory, make sure you change the CSS for the **#quizParent** element and **folderName** variable in quiz.js to match the new path.
- Make sure the variable **rooturl** in quiz.js matches the root url of your website, with no slash at the end.
